## Introduction

Currently both of my personal projects are a work in progress and thus, as the projects develop the README.md of this repository will be expanded upon.

## Worlds 2022 LoL Project

The esports scene has grown rapidly over the recent years with some games being more popular than others. League of Legends (LoL) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game where 2 teams of 5 players select a character (referred to as champions in-game) to play as and work together to destroy a struture within the opposing teams base called the Nexus. The LoL esports scene is one of the largest, being in the top 5 biggest and most popular esports scenes. It's largest tournament is the World Championship where teams from all regions compete to win, the World Championship typically takes place in October each year. Being a fan of the game and it's esports scene I wanted to determine what where the deciding factors in the recent World Championship that took place this year and recently concluded as of writing, this World Championship took place from 29/09/2022 to 5/11/2022.
