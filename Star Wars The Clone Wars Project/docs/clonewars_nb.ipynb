Ahsoka relays this to Obi-Wan, who says he had inferred from the recently killed Count Dooku that Sidious is the name of the Sith Lord who orchestrated the Clone Wars. The captured Almec mentions that Maul had hoped to lure Anakin to Mandalore, but is assassinated by Saxon before he can reveal why. As Bo-Katan's and Rex's forces lead a final assault against Maul's Mandalorians, Ahsoka confronts Maul again, who reveals that Sidious has engineered the Republic and the Jedi's destruction, and asks Ahsoka to join him so that they could hopefully stop Sidious. When she demands to know his intentions with Anakin, Maul claims that Sidious wants to make him his new apprentice, and that he had hoped to kill Anakin before this happens. Refusing to believe him, Ahsoka fights Maul above the city, where she rescues him from falling to his death. She then leaves Maul to be captured by clone troopers, despite his frantic warnings that everyone will soon die.</td>\n",

Mace Windu and Yoda contact Ahsoka via hologram and reveal that Obi-Wan has tracked Grievous down to Utapau, indicating that the war may soon be over. On their way to Coruscant, however, Ahsoka senses Anakin falling to the dark side and helping Darth Sidious to kill Windu, moments before Sidious executes Order 66, which brands all Jedi as traitors to the Republic and orders their deaths. As Ahsoka's clone troopers, including Rex, suddenly turn on her, she is forced to escape, subdue Rex, and release Maul so that he may cause a distraction. With the help of three astromech droids, Ahsoka then discovers and removes the inhibitor chip controlling Rex from his brain, restoring his free will.</td>\n",

Forced to fight their way through the clones, Ahsoka tries to prevent Maul from getting away in their shuttle, but fails. Just barely clearing the doomed ship, Ahsoka and Rex escape to the moon, where they respectfully bury the clones and Ahsoka discards one of her lightsabers. Years later, some time into the Galactic Empire's reign, Darth Vader arrives on the moon and recovers Ahsoka's lightsaber from the wrecked cruiser.</td>\n",

Anakin, Rex, Bad Batch and Echo embark on a mission to strike at the heart of Trench's command ship, all the while questioning the rescued clone's loyalty to the Republic after unwittingly serving the Separatists. Proving his loyalty once more, Echo uses his cybernetic implants to foil the droid forces on Anaxes, but Trench activates a bomb that could destroy most of the planet. Anakin confronts Trench and successfully obtains the deactivation code before executing the admiral. As the Republic emerges victorious, Rex gives Echo permission to join the Bad Batch.  \n",

Ahsoka relays this to Obi-Wan, who says he had inferred from the recently killed Count Dooku that Sidious is the name of the Sith Lord who orchestrated the Clone Wars. The captured Almec mentions that Maul had hoped to lure Anakin to Mandalore, but is assassinated by Saxon before he can reveal why. As Bo-Katan's and Rex's forces lead a final assault against Maul's Mandalorians, Ahsoka confronts Maul again, who reveals that Sidious has engineered the Republic and the Jedi's destruction, and asks Ahsoka to join him so that they could hopefully stop Sidious. When she demands to know his intentions with Anakin, Maul claims that Sidious wants to make him his new apprentice, and that he had hoped to kill Anakin before this happens. Refusing to believe him, Ahsoka fights Maul above the city, where she rescues him from falling to his death. She then leaves Maul to be captured by clone troopers, despite his frantic warnings that everyone will soon die.  \n",

Just barely clearing the doomed ship, Ahsoka and Rex escape to the moon, where they respectfully bury the clones and Ahsoka discards one of her lightsabers.
